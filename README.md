This program, originally released with [Sipkens et al. (2020a)][1_JAS1],
is designed to invert tandem measurements of aerosol size distributions.
This includes the inversion of particle mass analyzer-differential mobility analyzer
(PMA-DMA) data to find the two-dimensional mass-mobility distribution.

The results of the aforementioned paper can be produced by running `main_jas20a`
in [v1.1][code_v11] of this code. See Section
[2.1.2](#212-script-associated-with-the-original-j-aerosol-sci-paper)
of this README for more details.

This program is organized into several: classes (folders starting with the `@` symbol),
packages (folders starting with the `+` symbol), and scripts that form the
base of the program and will be detailed in this README.

## 1. General description and problem definition

Size characterization is critical to understanding the role of aerosols in various
roles, ranging from climate change to novel nanotechnologies. Aerosol size
distributions have typically been resolved only with respect to a single quantity
or variable. With the increasing frequency of tandem measurements, this program
is designed to move towards inferring two-dimensional distributions of aerosol
particle size. This kind of analysis requires a double deconvolution, that is
the inversion of a double integral. While this may complicate the process, the
information gained is quite valuable, including the distribution of aerosol
quantities and the identification of multiple particle types which may be challenging
from one-dimensional analyses or when simply computing summary parameters.

Mathematically, the problem to be solved here is of the form

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N_i(a_i*,b_i*)=N_{\text{tot}}\int_0^{\infty}{\int_0^{\infty}{K(a_i*,b_i*,a,b)\cdot{p(a,b)}\cdot\text{d}a\cdot\text{d}b}})

where:
- *a* and *b* are two aerosol properties (e.g. the logarithm of the particle
mass and mobility diameter, such that *a* = log<sub>10</sub>*m* and *b* =
log<sub>10</sub>*d*<sub>m</sub>);
- *N<sub>i</sub>* is some measurement, most often a number of counts of
particles, at some *i*<sup>th</sup> measurement setpoint or location;
- *N*<sub>tot</sub> is the total number of particles in the measured volume of
aerosol, that is the product of the particle number concentration, the flow rate,
and the total sampling time;
- *K*(*a<sub>i</sub>**,*b<sub>i</sub>**,*a*,*b*)
is a kernel containing device transfer functions or other discretization information;
and *p*(*a*,*b*) is a two-dimensional size distribution.

Inversion refers to finding *p*(*a*,*b*) from some set of measurements,
{*N*<sub>1</sub>,*N*<sub>2</sub>,...}. For computation, the
two-dimensional size distribution is discretized, most
simply by representing the quantity on a regular rectangular grid with *n*<sub>a</sub>
discrete points for the first type of particle size (that is for *a*, e.g. particle mass)
and *n*<sub>b</sub> for the second type of particle size (that is for *b*,
e.g. particle mobility diameter). In this case, we define a global index for the grid,
*j*, and vectorize the distribution, such that

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_j=p(a_j,b_j))

This results is a vector with *n*<sub>a</sub> x *n*<sub>b</sub> total entries.
This vectorized form is chosen over a two-dimensional **x** so that the problem can be
represented as a linear system of equations.
Here, the solution is assumed to be uniform within each element, in which case

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N_i(a_i*,b_i*){\approx}N_{\text{tot}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_a\cdot{n_b}}{p(a_j,b_j)\int_{a_j}{\int_{b_j}{K(a_i*,b_i*,a_j,b_j)\cdot\text{d}a\cdot\text{d}b}}})

(where the integrals are over the two-dimensional area of the *j*<sup>th</sup> element
in [*a*,*b*]<sup>T</sup> space). This results is a linear system of equations of the form

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?{\mathbf{b}}={\mathbf{Ax}}+{\mathbf{e}})

where **b** is the data vector (i.e. *b<sub>i</sub>* = *N<sub>i</sub>*);
**A** is a discrete form of the kernel,

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A_{i,j}=\int_{a_j}{\int_{b_j}{K(a_i*,b_i*,a_j,b_j)\cdot\text{d}a\cdot\text{d}b}}})

and **e** is a vector of measurement errors that
corrupt the results of **Ax**. This is the problem that the current code is designed to solve.


## 2. Scripts in upper directory

### 2.1 Main scripts (main*.m)

The `main*` scripts in the top directory of the program constitute the primary code
that can be called to demonstrate use of the code. The are generally composed of
four parts.

#### 2.1.1 General structure: Four parts

- **STEP 1**: Optionally, one can define a phantom used to generate synthetic data and a
ground truth. The `Phantom` class, described in Section [3.2](#32-phantom-class), is designed to
perform this task. The results is an instance of the `Grid` class, which is
described in Section [3.1](#31-grid-class), and a vector, `x_t`, that contains a vectorized form of
the phantom distribution, defined on the output grid.

- **STEP 2A**: One must now generate a model matrix, `A`, which relates the distribution,
`x`, to the data, `b`, such that **Ax** = **b**. This requires one to compute
the transfer functions of all of the devices involved in the measurement
as well as the grids on which `x` and `b` are to be defined.
For phantom distributions, the grid for `x` can generated using
the `Phantom` class. In all other cases, the grid for `x` and `b` can be
generated by creating an instance of the `Grid` class described below.

- **STEP 2b**: One must also define some set of data in an appropriate format. For
simulated data, this is straightforward: `b = A*x;`. For experimental data, the data
should be imported along with either (i) a grid on which the data is defined or
(ii) using a series of setpoints for the DMA and PMA. For experimental data,
one must have knowledge of the setpoint before computing `A`. Accordingly,
the data may first be imported prior to Step 2A.
Also in this step, one should include some definition of the
expected uncertainties in each point in `b`, encoded in the matrix
`Lb`. For those cases involving counting noise, this can be
approximated as

    ```Matlab
    Lb = theta*diag(sqrt(b));
    ```

    where `theta` is related to the total number of particle counts as described in
[Sipkens et al. (2020a)][1_JAS1]. The function `add_noise` is
included in the `+tools` package to help with noise creation, and more
information on the noise model is provided in [Sipkens et al. (2017)][6_AO17].

- **STEP 3**: With this information, one can proceed to implement various inversion
approaches, such as those available in the `+invert` package described below.
Preset groupings on inversion approaches are available in the
`run_inversions*` scripts, also described below.

- **STEP 4**: Finally, one can post-process and visualize the results as desired. The
`Grid` class allows for a simple visualization of the inferred distribution
by calling the `plot2d_marg` method of this class. This plots both the
retrieved distribution as well as the marginalized distribution on each of
the axes, taking the reconstruction (e.g. `x_tk1`, `x_lsq`) as an input.

#### 2.1.2 Script associated with the original J. Aerosol Sci. paper

Of particular note, the `main_jas20a.m` script is designed to replicate the results
in the associated paper [Sipkens et al. (2020a)][1_JAS1], as noted above. Minor
differences in the Euclidean error stem from using a smaller search space when
optimizing the regularization parameter for Tikhonov regularization. The narrower
range in the updated code provides a better optimized regularization parameter
and thus a slightly smaller Euclidean error.

### 2.2 Scripts to run a series of inversion methods (run_inversions*.m)

As noted above, these scripts are intend to bundle a series of
inversion methods into a single line of code in the `main*` scripts.
 This can include optimization routines, included in the `+invert`
 package, which run through several values of the regularization parameters.

The lettered scripts roughly perform as follows:

- `run_inversions_a` - Attempts to optimize the regularization parameter in
the Tikhonov, MART, Twomey, and Twomey-Markowski approaches.

- `run_inversions_b` - Re-runs inversion at the set of optimal parameters
produced by *run_inversions_a.m*. Can be modified to adjust the optimization
approach used in the Tikhonov solvers (e.g. specifying the `'non-neg'` option).

- `run_inversions_c` - A simple set of the Tikhonov and Twomey approaches where
the user must explicitly set the regularization parameter of the Tikhonov
schemes.

- `run_inversions_d` - Run the inversion methods multiple times and time the
length of time required to produce a reconstruction.

Other methods are available to combine other sets of inversion techniques.

## 3. Classes

Classes are contained in folders starting with the `@` symbol.

### 3.1 Grid class

Grid is a class developed to discretize a parameter space (e.g. mass-mobility space).
This is done using a simple rectangular grid that can have linear, logarithmic
or custom spaced elements along the edges. Methods are designed
to make it easier to deal with gridded data, allowing users to reshape
vectorized data back to a 2D grid (`reshape` method) or vice versa. Other
methods allow for plotting the 2D representation of vector data (`plot2d` method) or
calculate the gradient of vector data (`grad` method).

Instances of the Grid class can primarily be constructed in two ways. First,
one can specify a `span` for the grid to cover in the parameter space. The span
is specified using a 2 x 2 matrix, where the first row corresponds to the
span for the first dimension of the parameter space (e.g. mass) and the second
row corresponds to the span for the second dimension of the parameter space (e.g. mobility).
For example, if one wanted to logarithmically discretize mass space between
0.01 and 100 fg and mobility space between 10 and 1000 nm, one could call:

```Matlab
span = [0.01,100; 10,1000]; % span of space to be covered
ne = [10,12]; % number of elements for each dimension
grid = Grid(span,ne,'logarithmic'); % create instance of Grid
```

Second, one can supply a 1 x 2 cell array of edges, where the first entry is the center
of the elements in the first dimension of parameter space and the second entry
of the elements in the second dimension of parameter space. For example, to make
a simple grid with elements at 0.1 and 1 fg in mass space and
10, 200, and 1000 nm in mobility space, one would call:

```Matlab
edges = {[0.1,1], [10,200,1000]}; % cell array of edge vectors
grid = Grid(edges,[],'logarithmic'); % create instance of Grid
```

Note that the number of elements is not required in this instance, as it is
implied by the length of the vectors given in `edges`. The `'logarithmic'`
argument is still required to specify where nodes would be placed between
the elements.

Both the data, **b**, and two-dimensional size distribution, **x**, vectors
can be defined with respect to an instance of this class. Generally, the data
will only rely on the center of the elements on the grid (the width of the grid
elements has little meaning for data).
The vectors are arranged such that the first entry corresponds
to the smallest size in both dimensions. The vector proceeds, first with
increasing the first size dimension (e.g. for mass-mobility distributions this is mass
by default) and then with increasing the second size dimension. Vectorizing the
2D gridded data can be done using the colon operand, i.e. `x(:)`, or using
the `vectorize` method.

#### 3.1.1 Support for partial grids

The current program also supports creating partial grids, made up of a regular
grid where certain elements are ignored or missing. This allows practitioners
to ignore certain regions in the grid that may have higher uncertainties or
are otherwise unphysical. Quantities defined on partial grids have a
reduced dimension, often speeding inversion.

For mass-mobility measurements, this can be used to
block out particles with extraordinarily high densities.

These partial grids are also useful for PMA-SP2 inversion, where part of the
grid will be unphysical.

Partial grids can be created using the `Grid.partial`, which cuts the grid
about a line specified by a y-intercept and slope. All of the grid points with
a center above this line is removed from the grid. For example, if one wanted
to create a grid where all of the points above the 1-1 line shoudl be removed
(as is relevant for PMA-SP2 inversion), one can call

```Matlab
grid = grid.partial(0,1);
```

For partial grids:

1. `Grid.ispartial` will be 1 (i.e. true),
2. `Grid.missing` contains a list of the global indices for the missing pixels,
3. `Grid.cut` contains the y-intercept and slope of the line used in making the cut (which is used in marginalization to only partially weight points that are cut off),
4.	`Grid.elements` is updated to only list the center of the elements that
are left in the grid (i.e. have indices that are not listed in `Grid.ismissing`),
5.	`Grid.nelements` similarly only lists the edges of pixels that remain in the partial grid, and
6.	`Grid.adj` is updated to only list the elements/pixels that are adjacent on the partial grid.

The `Grid.edges` and `Grid.nodes` properties remain unchanged and refer to the
underlying grid structure prior to any of the grid points being removed.

Methods specific to partial grids include:
1.	`Grid.partial2full(x)` will convert a partial x (resolved with only the remaining points on the grid) to one resolved on the original grid, filling the missing points with zeros. I use this to plot and marginalize the distributions (i.e. plots will have zeros in all of the missing elements/pixels) and
2.	`Grid.full2partial(x)` will do the reverse of above, converting a full x (with all of the points from the original grid) to one resolved on the partial grid.

Most other Grid methods will operate on partial grids. For example, the `Grid.marginalization` method will only sum the pixels that are still on the grid (exploiting the fact that the other pixels are necessarily zero), including accounting for the fact that pixels on the diagonal are only half pixels (i.e. they are triangles rather than rectangular elements). The `Grid.plot2d` method, equally, will plot zeros in the upper left triangle. The `Grid.l1` method will generate the first-order Tikhonov L matrix for the modified grid (only considering pixels that are adjacent on the partial grid). The `Grid.ray_sum` method will sum the distribution along some ray (i.e. along some line), assuming missing pixels are zero and do not contribute to the ray-sum. The list goes on.


### 3.2 Phantom class

Phantom is a class developed to contain the parameters and other information
for the phantom distributions that are used in testing the different inversion
methods. Currently, the phantom class is programmed to primarily produce
bivariate lognormal distributions and secondarily distributions
that are lognormal with mobility and conditional normal for mass
following [Buckley et al. (2017)][3_Buck].

The Phantom class parameterizes the aerosol distribution in two
possible ways:

- **OPTION 1**: Most generally, the class parameterized the distribution
using a mean, `mu`, and covariance matrix, `Sigma`. For lognormal-lognormal
distributions, the mean and covariance are given in
[log<sub>10</sub>*m*, log<sub>10</sub>*d*]<sup>T</sup>
space. For phantoms of the form provided by [Buckley et al. (2017)][3_Buck]
are lognormal in mobility diameter space and conditionally normally
distributed in mass space.

- **OPTION 2**: The distribution is parameterized using the typical
mass-mobility parameters, stored in the `p` field. This includes
parameters, such as the geometric mean diameter, `dg`;
mass-mobility exponent, `Dm`; and the effective density of particles
with a mobility diameter of 100 nm `rho_100`.

- **OPTION 3**: Use a preset or sample distribution, which are loaded using
a string and the `preset_phantoms` function. For example, the four sample phantoms from
[Sipkens et al. (2020a)][1_JAS1] can be called using strings encompassing
the distribution numbers or names from that work (e.g. the demonstration phantom
can be generated using `'1'` or `'demonstration'`). The demonstration phantom
is indicated in the image below.

<img src="docs/distr1.png" width="500px">

Conversion between the `mu` and `Sigma` parameterization and the
`p` structure parameterization can be accomplished using the `cov2p`
method of the Phantom class and vice versa using the `p2cov`
method of the Phantom class.

For experimental data, the Phantom class can also be used to derive
morphological parameters from the reconstructions. Of particular note,
the `fit` method of the Phantom class, takes a reconstruction, `x` and
the grid on which it is defined and creates a bivariate lognormal
phantom that most resembles the data. This done using least squares
analysis. The `p` properties of the Phantom class then contains many of the
morphological parameters of interest to practitioners measuring
mass-mobility distributions.

## 4. Packages

### 4.1 +kernel

This package is used to evaluate the transfer function of the different
instruments, such as the differential mobility analyzer (DMA),
particle mass analyzer (such as the CPMA or APM), and charging fractions.
Various functions within this package can generate the matrix `A`
that acts as the forward model.

The transfer function for the DMA uses the analytical
expressions of [Stozenburg et al. (2018)][Stolz18].

Transfer function evaluation for a PMA can
proceed using one of two inputs either (i) a `sp` structure or (ii) an
instance of the `Grid` class defined for the data setpoints.
Evaluation proceeds using the analytical expressions
of [Sipkens et al. (2020b)][2_AST] and the `tfer_pma` package provided with
that work. The package uses a `sp` structure to define the PMA setpoints.

#### 4.1.1 sp

The `sp` or setpoint structure is a structured array containing the information
necessary to define the device setpoints. For a DMA, the setpoint mobility diameter,
`d_star`, is sufficient to accomplish this task. For a PMA, a pair of parameters
is required to establish the setpoint. Pairings can be converted into a `sp` structured
array using the `get_setpoint` function included with the `tfer_pma` package described
below. Generally, this function can be placed inside a loop that generates an entry
in `sp` for each available setpoint. The output structure will contain all of the
relevant parameters that could be used to specify that setpoint, including
mass setpoint (assuming a singly charged particle), `m_star`; the resolution, `Rm`;
the voltage, `V`; and the electrode speeds, `omega*`. A sample `sp` is shown below.

| Fields  | m_star    | V      | Rm | omega | omega1 | omega2 | alpha | beta  | m_max    |
| ------- | --------- | ------ | -- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 1       | 4.51e-19  |	81.638 | 3  | 692.6 | 703.4  | 682.0 |	47.91 |	2.359 |	6.01e-19 |
| 2       | 7.67e-19  |	110.68 | 3  | 618.3 | 627.9  | 608.9 |	42.77 |	2.106 |	1.02e-18 |
| 3       | 1.30e-18  |	148.76 | 3  | 549.5 | 558.1  | 541.2 |	38.01 |	1.872 |	1.74e-18 |
| 4       | 2.22e-18  |	198.02 | 3  | 486.1 | 493.7  | 478.7 |	33.63 |	1.656 |	2.96e-18 |
| ... |

As an example, the array can be generated from a vector of mass setpoints assuming
a resolution of *R*<sub>m</sub> = 10 and PMA properties specified
in `prop_pma` using:

```Matlab
sp(ii) = tfer_pma.get_setpoint(prop_pma,...
    'm_star',m_star,'Rm',10); % generate iith setpoint
```

#### 4.1.2 grid_b

Alternatively, one can generate a grid corresponding to the data points. This can
speed transfer function evaluation be exploiting the structure of the setpoints
to minimize the number of function evaluations (using the `gen_A_grid` function).

### 4.2 +tfer_pma

This package is used in evaluating the transfer function of the particle mass
analyzers (PMAs), such as the aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM) and centrifugal
particle mass analyzer (CPMA). PMA transfer functions are evaluated using the
analytical transfer functions derived by [Sipkens et al. (2020b)][2_AST], including
different approximations for the particle migration velocity and options for transfer
functions that include diffusion. For more details on the theory, one is referred to
the referenced work. The package also contains some standard reference
functions used in evaluating the DMA transfer function, i.e. in `tfer_dma`.

This is imported from a package distributed with [Sipkens et al. (2020b)][2_AST]
and is available in a parallel repository
[https://github.com/tsipkens/mat-tfer-pma](https://github.com/tsipkens/mat-tfer-pma)
and the associated archive [(Sipkens et al., 2019)][5_code].

The current implementation corresponds to v1.3 of that code.

### 4.3 +invert

The invert package contains various functions used to invert the measured data
for the desired two-dimensional distribution. This includes implementations of
least-squares, Tikhonov regularization, Twomey, Twomey-Markowski (including using
the method of [Buckley et al. (2017)][3_Buck]), and the multiplicative algebraic
reconstruction technique (MART).

An important note in connection with these methods is that they do not have the
matrix `Lb` as an input. This is done for two reasons:

1. to allow for the case where the data noise is entirely unknown, thereby
considering a traditional, unweighted least-squares analysis
(though, this is not recommended) and

2. to avoid unnecessary repeat computation of the products `Lb*A` and `Lb*b`.

To incorporate `Lb`, use `Lb*A` and `Lb*b` when calling the inversion
functions for the input `A` and `b` arguments.

Details on the available approaches to inversion are provided in the
associated paper, [Sipkens et al. (2020a)][1_JAS1].

Development is underway on the use of an exponential
distance covariance function to correlate pixel values and reduce
reconstruction errors [Sipkens et al. (Under preparation)][4].

### 4.4 +optimize

This package mirrors the content of the +invert package but
aims to determine the optimal number of
iterations for the Twomey and MART schemes or the optimal prior
parameter set for the other methods.
This includes some methods aimed to optimize the prior/regularization
parameters used in the reconstructions, without knowledge of the data.

Of particular note are a subset of the methods that implement
evaluation of the Bayes factor for a range of methods, namely the
`bayesf*.m` methods. The functions have inputs that mirror the functions
in the `invert` package, this means that data uncertainties can be included
in the procedure by giving `Lb*A` as an input to the program in the place of `A`.
The methods general take `lambda` as a separate parameter, to promote the
stability of the algorithm. 

### 4.5 +tools

A series of utility functions that serve various purposes, including printing
a text-based progress bar (based on code from
[Samuel Grauer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel_Grauer))
and a function to convert mass-mobility distributions to effective
density-mobility distributions.

The `overlay*` functions produce overlay to be placed on top of plots in
mass-mobility space. For example, `overlay_phantom` will plot the line
corresponding to the least-squares line representative of the phantom (equivalent
to the mass-mobility relation for mass-mobility phantoms) and ellipses representing
isolines one, two, and three standard deviations from the center of the distribution.
